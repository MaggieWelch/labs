Each one is complicated in its own way, which makes the task of standardizing data organization difficult. The sentance about being able to easily figure out what are observations and what are variables, however it ia difficult to actually define them, speaks to the fact that for a majority of the time when using data, you know in your head whats a variable and whats an observation, however you have to figure out a way for what you're thinking to translate into code. Generally, the intro for section 2 speaks to how the semantic meaning of the data is really what we are interested in, and the process of getting there can be more efficient through organization."

The data in table 4 is messy because the observations are in columns, and the variables are in rows. Additionally, the columns make up the variable of income, however there is no labeling of the column to indicate the name of the variable. By melting the data set, you turn columns into rows and ensure that column headers are names of variables as opposed to values as seen in table 4."

        "^^These lines of code, first prints a crosstab (contingency table) of missing values in length_NA against the type column. It then modifies the length column by replacing values where type == 4 with 0, and where type == 9 with NaN. this reduces the number of missing variables. After that, it recalculates length_NA to check which values in length are missing (NaN), prints the updated crosstab, and the total number of missing values. Finally, the column length is assigned to df['ImposedSentenceAllChargeInContactEvent'], and the length and type variables are deleted to free up memory."
